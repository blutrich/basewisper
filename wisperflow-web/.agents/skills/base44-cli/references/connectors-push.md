# base44 connectors push

Push local connector configurations to Base44, synchronizing scopes and handling OAuth authorization.

## Usage

```bash
npx base44 connectors push
```

## What It Does

1. **Reads local connectors** from your `base44/connectors/` directory
2. **Syncs with Base44** - updates scopes for existing connectors
3. **Adds new connectors** - any new connector types trigger OAuth authorization
4. **Removes unlisted connectors** - connectors not in your local files are removed from Base44

## OAuth Authorization Flow

When you add a new connector, it needs to be authorized:

1. The CLI detects which connectors need authorization
2. You're prompted: "Open browser to authorize now?"
3. If you accept, the browser opens to the OAuth provider (Google, Slack, etc.)
4. You log into your account and approve the requested permissions
5. The browser closes and the CLI confirms authorization

**Important**: You choose which account to connect by logging into it during the OAuth flow. For example, if you have multiple Google accounts, you select which one to use in the Google login screen.

## Example Output

### Pushing connectors (no new authorization needed)

```
Found 2 connectors to push: googlecalendar, slack
✓ Connectors pushed

Summary:
  Synced: googlecalendar, slack
```

### Pushing new connectors (authorization required)

```
Found 3 connectors to push: googlecalendar, slack, notion
✓ Connectors pushed

2 connector(s) require authorization in your browser:
  slack: https://auth.base44.io/oauth/...
  notion: https://auth.base44.io/oauth/...

? Open browser to authorize now? › Yes

Opening browser for slack...
✓ slack authorization complete

Opening browser for notion...
✓ notion authorization complete

Summary:
  Synced: googlecalendar
  Added: slack, notion
```

### Removing connectors

If you delete a connector file locally and push, it will be removed:

```
Found 1 connectors to push: googlecalendar
✓ Connectors pushed

Summary:
  Synced: googlecalendar
  Removed: slack
```

## CI/CD Environments

In non-interactive environments (no TTY, such as CI/CD pipelines), the OAuth flow is skipped automatically:

```
Skipped OAuth in non-interactive mode. Run 'base44 connectors push' locally or open the links above to authorize.
```

You must run `npx base44 connectors push` locally to complete authorization for new connectors.

## Skipping Authorization

If you choose not to authorize immediately, the connectors remain in a pending state:

```
? Open browser to authorize now? › No

Authorization skipped. Pending: slack, notion. Run 'base44 connectors push' again to complete.
```

Run the command again when you're ready to authorize.

## Summary Status Meanings

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Synced | Connector already existed, scopes updated if needed |
| Added | New connector successfully authorized |
| Removed | Connector was deleted from Base44 (not in local files) |
| Failed | Authorization timed out, failed, or was skipped |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Authorization timed out | Re-run `npx base44 connectors push` and complete OAuth faster |
| Authorization failed | Check that you approved all requested permissions |
| Wrong account connected | Remove the connector file, push to delete it, then add it back and authorize with the correct account |
| Browser didn't open | Copy the URL shown in the terminal and open it manually |
